Yaks are beautiful, gentle creatures that will (probably) trample you if you get in their way.

Shaving. Well, shaving is a useless tradition, at least in my opinion. Anyone who knows me personally knows that I donâ€™t shave my face (or cut my hair for that matter) for periods of sometimes years. In other words, I actually just look like a yak half the time.

But, let me tell you about a time when I shaved a yak. The job is still unfinished, and things are already starting to grow back.

If you learn Lisp correctly, you can grok all programming styles with
it: procedural, OO, predicate, functional, pure or full of
side-effects. Recursion will be your friend, function references your
allies, you will truly know what a closure is, and that an argument
stack is actually a performance hack. You will see that the most
elegant way to solve a problem is to create a custom language, solve
the generic problem, and have your specific one fall out as a special
case. You will learn to truly separate intent from the bare metal, and
you will finally understand the two deepest secrets, which are really
the same secret, which we tell all, but so few understand, that code
and data are the same thing, but organize your data and your code will
follow.

CAR and CDR now return extra values.

The function CAR now returns two values.  Since it has to go to the trouble
to figure out if the object is carcdr-able anyway, we figured you might as
well get both halves at once.  For example, the following code shows how to
destructure a cons (SOME-CONS) into its two slots (THE-CAR and THE-CDR):

        (MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND (THE-CAR THE-CDR) (CAR SOME-CONS) ...)

For symmetry with CAR, CDR returns a second value which is the CAR of the
object.  In a related change, the functions MAKE-ARRAY and CONS have been
fixed so they don't allocate any storage except on the stack.  This should
hopefully help people who don't like using the garbage collector because
it cold boots the machine so often.

Note that LET *could* have been defined by:

        `(LET ((LET ',LET))

interactive read-execute-diagnose loop window.  [Note that for 360
compatibility, all input lines are truncated to 80 characters.]  This
window also maintains a mouse-sensitive display of critical job parameters
such as dataset allocation, core allocation, channels, etc.  When a JCL
syntax error is detected or your job ABENDs, the window-oriented JCL
debugger is entered.  The JCL debugger displays appropriate OS/360 error
messages (such as IEC703, "disk error") and allows you to dequeue your job.

The garbage collector now works.  In addition a new, experimental garbage
collection algorithm has been installed.  With SI:%DSK-GC-QLX-BITS set to 17,
(NOT the default) the old garbage collection algorithm remains in force; when
virtual storage is filled, the machine cold boots itself.  With SI:%DSK-GC-
QLX-BITS set to 23, the new garbage collector is enabled.  Unlike most garbage
collectors, the new gc starts its mark phase from the mind of the user, rather
than from the obarray.  This allows the garbage collection of significantly
more Qs.  As the garbage collector runs, it may ask you something like "Do you
remember what SI:RDTBL-TRANS does?", and if you can't give a reasonable answer
in thirty seconds, the symbol becomes a candidate for GCing.  The variable
SI:%GC-QLX-LUSER-TM governs how long the GC waits before timing out the user.

***** Special AI Seminar (abstract)

It has been widely recognized that AI programs require expert knowledge
in order to perform well in complex domains.  But knowledge alone is not
sufficient for some applications; wisdom is needed as well.  Accordingly,
we have developed a new approach to artificial intelligence which we call
"wisdom engineering".  As a test of our ideas, we have written IMMANUEL, a
wisdom based system for the task domain of western philosophical thought.
IMMANUEL was supplied initially with 200 wisdom units which contained wisdom
about such elementary concepts as mind, matter, being, nothingness, and so
forth.  IMMANUEL was then allowed to run freely, guided by the heuristic
rules contained in its heterarchically organized meta wisdom base.  IMMANUEL
succeeded in rediscovering most of the important philosophical ideas developed
in western culture over the course of the last 25 centuries, including those
underlying Plato's theory of government, Kant's metaphysics, Nietzsche's theory
of value, and Husserl's phenomenology.  In this seminar, we will describe
IMMANUEL's achievements and internal architecture.  We will also briefly
discuss our recent efforts to apply wisdom engineering to oil exploration.

Gene Structure, Organization and Expression,
	poem on a paper by A. W. Nienhuis

Well, we thought that we had finally figured it out!
We knew what the structure of genes was about.
"It's simply a piece of the old DNA,
Transcribed and translated the usual way;
The way that Jacob and Monod always said.
It's simple," we said, "when it get through your head."
But there's two kind of Karyotes -- there's Eu- and there's Pro-
And what's true for E. Coli just isn't so,
When it comes to the genes of a mouse or a man.
Mother Nature, it seems, has used more than one plan.
Dr. Nienhuis informs us it's much more exotic
When dealing with animals Eukaryotic.
Their chromosones aren't just ribbons of genes,
One coming right after the other, it seems.
Eu-genes are in pieces -- they're really quite split.
A Eu-gene's got introns in the middle of it.
And this complication just leads us to more:
RNA now needs cutting and splicing before
It can serve as a template, appropriate to
The making of proteins.  That's /one/ thing we knew.
                -- Donald Patterson

Hemoglobinopathies -- from Phenotype to Genotype
	poem on a paper by W. F. Anderson

We'd like to explain what pathology means,
In terms of what's wrong with the structure of genes;
Know if a control or a structural locus
Constitutes the exact pathological focus.
Dr. Anderson's talk has made it quite clear
That the answers to some of these questions are near.
At least with respect to the globins, we know
Why some mutant's erythrocyte levels are low.
With the help of the enzymes that slice DNA,
And cloning techniques, we now have a way
To study the actual sequences of bases;
To know when those purines are not in their places.
In humans who have a resistant anemia
That goes by the general name, thalassemia,
Globin genes can be missing, we don't know where they went --
Perhaps an unequal crossover event
Has caused their deletion -- whatever -- they're gone.
In others they're present, but never turned on.
The latter are viewed with much more expectation
As keys to the problem of gene regulation.
What's needed are animal models of these
So look, animal hematologists, /please!/

Histocompatibility, Disease and Aging
	poem on a paper by E. Yunis

"The crown of life, our play's last act,"
Cicero on old age was opining.
What he didn't know, but now is a fact:
It's then your T-cells are declining,
Too many tick-tocks of the old thymic clock;
It runs down like a watch on the shelf.
Then suppressor T-cells aren't sufficient to block
B-cell clones that arise against self.
This theory's supported, Dr. Yunis explained,
By studies in mice and in man.
The data suggest that the program's ingrained;
It's a genetic kind of a plan.
It seems to depend on your HLA type.
If you have a desire to die late,
And your wish is, in time, to become overripe,
It is better not to B-8.

    This is a tale of a sorry quest
    To master pure code at the T guru's behest
    I enrolled in a class that appealing did seem
    For it promised to teach fine things like T3 and Scheme

    The first day went fine; we learned of cells
    And symbols and lists and functions as well
    Lisp I had mastered and excited was I
    For to master T3 my hackstincts did cry

    I sailed through the first week with no problems at all
    And I even said "closure" instead of "function call"
    Then said the master that ready were we
    To start real hacking instead of simple theory

    Will you, said he, write me a function please
    That in lists would associate values with keys
    I went home and turned on my trusty Apollo
    And wrote a function whose definition follows:

        (cdr (assq key a-list))

    A one-liner I thought, fool that I was
    Just two simple calls without a COND clause
    But when I tried this function to run
    CDR didn't think that NIL was much fun

                   "A Short Ballad Dedicated to Program Growth"

    So I tried again like the good King of yore
    And of code I easily generated some more:

        (cond ((assq key a-list) => cdr))

    It got longer but purer, and it wasn't too bad
    But then COND ran out and that was quite sad

    Well, that isn't hard to fix, I was told
    Just write some more code, my son, be bold
    Being young, not even a moment did I pause
    I stifled my instincts and added a clause

        (cond ((assq key a-list) => cdr)
              (else nil))

    Sometimes this worked and sometimes it broke
    I debugged and prayed and even had a stroke
    Many a guru tried valiantly to help
    But undefined datums their efforts did squelch.

                -- Ashwin Ram,

    I returneth once more to the great sage of T
    For no way out of the dilemma I could see
    He said it was easy -- more lines must I fill
    with code, for FALSE was no longer NIL.

        (let ((val (assq key a-list)))
           (cond (val (cdr val))
                 (else nil)))

    You'd think by now I might be nearing the end
    Of my ballad which seems bad things to portend
    You'd think that we could all go home scot-free
    But COND eschewed VAL; it wanted #T

    So I went back to the master and appealed once again
    I said, pardon me, but now I'm really insane
    He said, no you're not really going out of your head
    Instead of just VAL, you must use NOT NULL instead

        (let ((val (assq key a-list)))
           (cond ((not (null? val)) (cdr val))
                 (else nil)))

    My song is over and I'm going home to bed
    With this ineffable feeling that I've been misled
    And just in case my point you have missed
    Somehow I preferred (CDR (ASSQ KEY A-LIST))

Clearly one can make this generalization and people can live with it.
We could make the generalization that LIST can take some other options,
perhaps stating that we want a CDR-coded list, and it can define some
accessor functions, and some auxilliary storage, and make arrays a
specialization of CONS cells, but that would be silly (wouldn't it??).

The point is that vectors are a useful enough concept to not need to suffer
being a specialization of something else.

Visual Basic is not an object oriented language, it is an object based

To exchange two variables in LISP without using a third variable:

%
ITEM 172 (Gosper):

The fundamental operation for building list structure, called CONS, is
defined  to:  find a free cell  in  memory, store the  argument in it,
remove it from the set of free cells, return a pointer to it, and call
the garbage collector when  the set is empty. This  can be done in two
instructions:

CONS:   EXCH A,[EXCH A,[...[PUSHJ P,GC]...]]
        EXCH A,CONS

Of course, the address-linked chain of EXCH's indicated by the nested
brackets is concocted by the garbage collector. This method has the
additional advantage of not constraining an accumulator for the free
storage pointer.

UNCONS: HRLI A,(EXCH A,)
        EXCH A,CONS
        EXCH A,@CONS

Returns cell addressed by A to free storage list; returns former cell
contents in A.

			The HACTRN

Once before a console dreary, while I programmed, weak and weary,
Over many a curious program which did TECO's buffer fill, --
While I pondered, nearly sleeping, suddenly there came a feeping,
As of something gently beeping, beeping with my console's bell.
"'Tis my DDT," I muttered, "feeping on my console's bell:
	Once it feeped, and now is still."

Ah, distinctly I remember that dark night in bleak December,
And each separate glowing symbol danced before me, bright and chill.
Eagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to borrow
From my HACTRN aid for sorrow -- sorrow for the bugs which fill --
For the strange unknown and nameless bugs which ever all my programs fill --
	Bugs which now I searched for still.

And the coughing, whirring, gritty fan I heard inside my TTY
Made me with fantastic terrors never known before to thrill;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart I stood repeating,
"'Tis some interrupt entreating DDT to signal me --
Some strange interrupt entreating DDT to signal me --
	Its importance surely nil."

Presently my soul grew stronger: hesitating then no longer
I decided that I would respond to this strange program's call;
TECO, which I then attended, to my soul more strength extended;
With ^Z I ascended, going to my DDT --
<esc><esc>V I typed, and answered soon my DDT --
	TECO there, and that was all!

Dumbly at my console peering, as I sat there, wondering, fearing,
Doubting now that any interrupt was ever there to call;
But the silence was unbroken, and my HACTRN gave no token,
And the only sound there spoken from my TTY's whirring fan --
The low and rough and distant sound came from my TTY's whirring fan --
	TECO there, and that was all.

Back into my TECO going, with my pounding heart now slowing,
Soon again I heard a feeping, somewhat louder than before.
"Surely," said I, "surely this is some strange bug of RMS's
Which an interrupt professes, though I have no other job;
Let me then ask DDT if it thinks there's another job --
	'Tis a bug, and nothing more!"

Again I went up to my HACTRN while cold shivers up my back ran
<esc><esc>V I typed, my jobs now once more to display.
Only TECO was there listed; though my trembling heart resisted
Yet I willed my hand, insisted, <esc>J to quickly type --
To answer this bold query DDT did hesitantly type
	A ghostly "FOOBARJ".

From <esc><esc>V protected, now, this phantom job, selected
Gave no clue to why it had invoked that former beeping shrill.
"Though," I said, "you're no inferior, I shall act as your superior
And examine your interior, this strange matter to explore."
Then I typed a 0/ this matter further to explore --
	Quoth the HACTRN, ":KILL".

Much I worried -- this outrageous bug might prove to be contagious,
Though thus far it had not seemed to do my TECO any ill:
For we cannot help concurring such a bug would cause a stirring,
Feeping on a console whirring, disappearing then from sight --
An evanescent mystery subjob disappearing then from sight
	With no clue but ":KILL"!

But my HACTRN, swapping, running, gave no further sign of cunning
By this unknown phantom, which was in a thirty second sleep;
None of this I comprehended; to my TECO I descended,
And in terror I pretended that the bug had gone away --
I pretended that for good the mystery bug had gone away --
	When my console gave a feep.

Now I quickly, hoping, praying, started up a PEEK displaying
All the the jobs and subjobs there which did the system fill:
What I found was quite unpleasant, for there was no FOOBAR present:
Only TECO was there present, underneath my DDT;
I quit the PEEK, and "FOOBAR<esc>J" typed out my DDT --
	Then quoth the HACTRN, ":KILL".

But -- this FOOBAR now beguiling all my sad soul into smiling --
I tightly grinned, determined that this glitch should cause nobody ill;
Now, into my armchair sinking, I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking why this unknown phantom job --
Why this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and unknown phantom job
	Feeped and did a ":KILL".

This I sat engaged in guessing, but conceived no thought expressing
How a phantom job could sound those strange and ghostly beeps;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining,
With the symbols coldly shining at me from the CRT,
With the bright, sharp symbols coldly shining on the CRT --
	Which suddenly gave seven feeps!

Then methought the air grew denser, filled with clouds which grew immenser,
As when under darkened daylight thick and stormy weather brews;
With some bit of hesitation stemming from my trepidation
Again I typed that incantation finding out how much I'd lose --
<esc><esc>V I typed again to find how much I'd lose --
	TECO there, and seven FOOs!

"Job!" said I, "with ghostly manner! -- subjob still, if LISP or PLANNER!
Whether accident, or feeping as another hacker wills!
Tell me now why I am losing, why my HACTRN you're abusing,
Which no doubt is of your choosing: echo truly on my screen!"
Then DDT as if in answer echoed quickly on my screen,
	Typing seven ":KILLs".

"Job!" said I, "with ghostly manner! -- subjob still, if LISP or PLANNER!
By the ITS above us which the DSKDMP doth fulfill,
I shall be the system's saviour: I shall mend your crude behaviour,
I shall halt your strange behaviour, and thee from the system lock!"
Madly, wildly laughing I made DDT invoke a LOCK,
	And quickly typed thereat -- "5KILL"!

"Be this now our sign of parting, phantom job!" I shrieked, upstarting,
As my HACTRN now informed me ITS was going down in 5:00.
"You have run your last instruction and performed your final function!"
But, refuting this deduction HACTRN then my TTY grabbed --
To type out yet another message HACTRN now my TTY grabbed --
	Quoth the HACTRN, "ITS REVIVED!"

And the FOOBAR, never sleeping, still is beeping, still is beeping
On the glaring console out from which I cannot even log!
And other happenings yet stranger indicate inherent danger
When bugs too easily derange or mung the programs of machines;
When programs too "intelligent" start taking over the machines:
	Is this the end of AutoProg?

I dreamed I was a brand new language,

I handled strings as fast as RPG,
And twice as easily.

I crunched numbers like COBOL,
Trees like APL,
And FORTRAN loaned its FORMATs and GO TOs,
The cause of many screws.

And then a man said, "Now we'll write a monitor,
With Multics what it's for.
Our project is begun;
We'll code in PL/I."

Then I saw thousands of coders
Searching for their bugs,
And then I heard them mentioning my name
And leaving me the blame.

Reclaimer, spare that tree!
Take not a single bit!
It used to point to me,
Now I'm protecting it.
It was the reader's CONS
That made it, paired by dot;
Now, GC, for the nonce,
Thou shalt reclaim it not.

That old familiar tree,
Whose CDRs and whose CARs
Are spread, o'er memory --
And wouldst thou it unparse?
GC, cease and desist!
In it no freelist store;
Oh spare that moby list
Now pointing throughout core!

It was my parent tree
When it was circular;
It pointed then to me:
I was its CADADR.
My CDR was a list,
My CAR a dotted pair --
That tree will sore be missed
If it remains not there.

And now I to thee point,
A saving root, old friend!
Thou shalt remain disjoint
From freelists to the end.
Old tree! The sweep still brave!
And, GC, mark this well:
While I exist to save,
Thou shan't reclaim one cell.

I think that I shall never see
A matrix lovely as a tree.
Trees are fifty times as fun
As structures a la PL/I
(Which Dijkstra claims are too baroque).
And SNOBOL's strings just can't compare
With all the leaves a tree may bear.
And COMIT strings are just a joke.
Vectors, tuples too, are nice,
But haven't the impressive flair
Of trees to which a LISP is heir.
A LISPer's life is paradise!

Many people think that JOSS
And others, too, are strictly boss;
And there are many BASIC fans
Who think their favorite language spans
All that would a user please.
Compared to LISP they're all a loss,
For none of them gives all the ease
With which a LISP builds moby trees.

RPG is just a nurd
(As you no doubt have often heard);
The record layouts are absurd,
And numbers packed in decimal form
Will never fit a base-two word
Without a veritable storm
Of gross conversions fro and to
With them arithmetic to do.
And one must allocate the field
Correct arithmetic to yield,
And decimal places represent
Truncation loss to circumvent:
Thus RPG is second-rate.
In LISP one needn't allocate
(That boon alone is heaven-sent!)
The scheme is sheer simplicity:
A number's just another tree.
When numbers threaten overflow
LISP makes the number tree to grow,
Extending its significance
With classic treelike elegance.
A LISP can generate reports,
Create a file, do chains and sorts;
But one thing you will never see
Is moby trees in RPG.

One thing the average language lacks
Is programmed use of push-down stacks.
But LISP provides this feature free:
A stack - you guessed it - is a tree.
An empty stack is simply NIL.
In order, then, the stack to fill
A CONS will push things on the top;
To empty it, a CDR will
Behave exactly like a pop.
A simple CAR will get you back
The last thing you pushed on the stack;
An empty stack's detectable
By testing with the function NULL.
Thus even should a LISPer lose
With PROGs and GOs, RETURNs and DOs,
He need his mind not overtax
To implement recursive hacks:
He'll utilize this clever ruse
Of using trees as moby stacks.
Some claim this method is too slow
Because it uses CONS so much
And thus requires the GC touch;
It has one big advantage, though:
You needn't fear for overflow.
Since LISP allows its trees to grow,
Stacks can to any limits go.

COBOL input is a shame:
The implementors play a game
That no two versions are the same.
And rocky is the FORTRAN road
One's alpha input to decode:
The FORMAT statement is to blame,
But on the user falls the load.
And FOCAL input's just a farce;
But all LISP input comes pre-parsed!
(The input reader gets its fame
By getting storage for each node
From lists of free words scattered sparse.
It parses all the input strings
With aid of mystic mutterings;
From dots and strange parentheses,
From zeros, sevens, A's and Z's,
Constructs, with magic reckonings,
The pointers needed for its trees.
It builds the trees with complex code
With rubout processing bestowed;
When typing errors do forebode
The rubout makes recovery tame,
And losers then will oft exclaim
Their sanity to LISP is owed -
To help these losers is LISP's aim.)

The flow-control of APL
And OS data sets as well
Are best described as tortured hell.
For LISPers everything's a breeze;
They neatly output all their trees
With format-free parentheses
And see their program logic best
By how their lovely parens nest.
While others are by GOs possessed,
And WHILE-DO, CASE, and all the rest,
The LISPing hackers will prefer
With COND their programs to invest
And let their functions all recur
When searching trees in maddened quest.

Expanding records of fixed size
Will quickly programs paralyze.
Though ISAM claims to be so wise
In allocating overflow,
Its data handling is too slow
And finding it takes many tries.
But any fool can plainly see
Inherent flexibility
In data structured as a tree.
When all their efforts have gone sour
To swell fixed records, losers glower.
But list reclaimers hour by hour
By setting all the garbage free
Yield CONSequent capacity:
Thus trees indefinitely flower.
(And trees run on atomic power!)

To men of sensibility
The lesson here is plain to see:
Arrays are used by clods like me,
But only LISP can make a tree.

               Alphabetical Order


MACLISP Ben PDP-6 (may its core increase!)
Awoke one jiffy from a deep dream of trees
And saw, by parsing out a TTY: .FILE. (DIR)
Scanning all the jobs, within the system here,
A PEEK, displaying on a CRT of gold;
A low USRTIM made the MACLISP bold:
And to the PEEK by CLI: a message sent,
"What displayest thou?" The message to it quickly went,
And the PEEK through CLA: a message did transduce,
And answer'd "The names of programs of practical use."
"And is mine one?" sent MACLISP. "Nay, not so,"
Replied the PEEK. MACLISP ran more slow
But swapping still. "I pray thee then," it sent,
"Display me as one that helps to systems implement."
The PEEK :KILLed and vanished. The next time
It ran again, in a display mode sublime,
It showed the names the Grim File Reaper had blessed,
And lo! MACLISP's name was thirty-seventh.

Circular MAPCAR and ANDCA'd negation,
Indirect JMP auto-incrementation,
Tangled spaghetti embroidered in stacks:
These are a few of my favorite hacks.

Mismatched DEFINE-TERMIN pairs with .QUOTEing,
Misbalanced brackets for macroed remoting,
PDP-6's with chess tourney plaques:
These are a few of my favorite hacks.

LAMBDAs as GO TOs and spooling on TPLs,
Flip-flops and bit drops and TRCE's in triples,
Crufty heuristics that prune minimax:
These are a few of my favorite hacks.

When the bugs strike,
When the disks crash,

I simply remember my favorite hacks
And then I feel even worse!

%
Circular MAPCAR


        A constant  or periodic series of arguments can  be given to a
mapped function  in LISP by supplying a circular  list to MAPCAR.  For
example:

        ((LAMBDA (C3)
                 (RPLACD C3 C3)
                 (MAPCAR 'CONS C3 THE-LIST))
         (LIST 3))

conses a 3 onto every element of THE-LIST.   Another  way  to use this
hack is to use MAP,  which allows the mapped function  to  splice  new
things into the circular list on the fly.
%
ANDCA'd negation


        The sequence of PDP-10 instructions

                MOVN A,NUMBER
                ANDCA A,NUMBER
                JUMPE A,FOO


jumps to FOO iff NUMBER is an exact power of two.



Indirect JMP auto-incrementation:


        On  the PDP-11, the  instruction JMP  @(R4)+ can be  used as a
combined subroutine call and subroutine return, using the technique of
threaded code.
%
Mismatched DEFINE-TERMIN


        Bizarre effects can be obtained in the MIDAS assembly language
for the PDP-10 by using  .QUOTE  to get  in  mismatched  DEFINE-TERMIN
pairs.  For example:

        DEFINE DEFSYM X/
        IRPS Z,,[X]
        IFNDEF Z,X
        .ELSE [
           $$TEM1==Z
           X
           IFN Z-$$TEM1,.ERR Z MULTIPLY .QUOTE`.QUOTE/DEFINED/`
        ]
        .ISTOP
        TERMIN TERMIN


The multiple .QUOTEs allow used of the  word  DEFINED  in  the  error
message.
%
Misbalanced brackets


        A standard  MIDAS hack for accumulating text in  a macro to be
assembled at a remote location is:

;initialization:
        DEFINE BNKBLK OP
        OP
        TERMIN                  ;BNKBLK accumulates text.

        DEFINE BLCODE NEWCFT
        BNKBLK [DEFINE BNKBLK OP
        OP]NEWCFT
        TERMIN
        TERMIN                  ;BLCODE adds its arg to the end of BNK

;add some text:
        BLCODE [FOO]            ;add FOO.
        BLCODE [BAR]            ;add BAR (note BLCODE inserts CRLF's,

;assemble what has been accumulated:
        BNKBLK                  ;which expands into ...
;       FOO
;       BAR


This hack depends on the misbalancing of the brackets in BLCODE with
respect to the DEFINE-TERMIN pairs.
%
TRCE's in triples

        The sequence of PDP-10 instructions:

                TRCE A,42
                TRCE A,42
                TRCE A,42

exchanges the 40 bit and the 2 bit in accumulator A.

Crufty heuristics

                 Both Ways, Now

           [to be sung to the tune of
                Both Sides, Now]


Decimal digits in a row,
Just set the dials and let 'er go.
The ENIAC was grossly slow --
    I used to code that way,
But then this Fortran came along;
I danced and sang a happy song:
So natural -- what could go wrong?
    I little knew, that day!
I've looked at Fortran both ways, now,
At II and IV, and still somehow,
It's rows of numbers I recall;
I really don't know Fortran at all.

Fortran IV is real good stuff,
But business hackers have it tough;
For them this Fortran's not enough --
    Then Cobol saved the day!
But now I sing a sad refrain;
This Cobol loss is no one's gain,
And writing programs is a pain
    (I get writer's cramp that way!)
I've looked at Cobol both ways, now,
I code in it, and still somehow,
It's FORMAT statements I recall;
I really don't know Cobol at all.

Cobol will for business do;
Accounts and payroll make it through
(And bills for zero dollars too --
    I get them every day!)
But those who hack symbolic frobs
Cannot make do with Cobol jobs,
And now I sing through anguished sobs,
    But Lisp is here to stay.
I've looked at Lisp code both ways, now,
At lambda forms, and still somehow,
It's Cobol statements I recall;
I really don't know Lisp at all.

        It  may surprise  some people to  know that the
PDP-10 instruction set,  far from being innovative, was
developed strictly along  classical lines.  Many of the
operation codes, for example, come from the Latin.  Two
fifth-declension   nouns  (declinable   only   in   the
singular) are as follows:

Nominative:             moves          hrres
Genitive:               movei          hrrei
Dative:                 movei          hrrei
Accusative:             movem          hrrem
Ablative:               move           hrre


        There  are, of  course, also  hlres, hrles, and
hlles.   These all derive from  the corresponding verbs
hrro, hrlo,  etc.  (second conjugation, semi-deponent.)
Thus when  playing chess  with MacHack  one might  say,
"movem hrro," that is, "I am hurrying a move."

        Similarly, the code  jffo ("i am jffing") comes
from  a defective  Latin verb  dating from  an era when
ancient  computers marked time  by periodically pushing
counters onto a wire.   The number of empty spaces left
on the  wire could easily be  counted by an instruction
very like  jffo,  from which  could be  calculated  the
number of "jiffies" (clock ticks; 1 jiffy = 40 seconds)
which had passed; hence the name.

        Teutonic languages have also lent several words
to the  PDP-10: rot ("red") derives  from the pieces of
decayed redwood traditionally used as temporary markers
in  older German manual shift  registers; while ash was
commonly the result  when an older German got disgusted
and threw his shift register in the fire.

"...   and so  the line  connecting the points  Ga and  Gb in gradient
space, which correspond  to the planes A and B  in image space, is the
set of points representing  positions of a plane see-sawing around the
line of intersection between A and B..."

Now I see; then I saw;
The planes of a cube have a linear law.
The endpoints of lines in the gradient space
Show where the see-sawing planes fall into place.

Caffeine doesn't help me composing this verse.
It only awakes me; my thoughts all disperse.

Why else are most students in classes asleep?

"...   the lines in gradient  space are perpendicular to  the lines in
image  space.   This  doesn't  provide  enough  constraints,  however.
Additional  equations may  be derived from  the intensity information.
One  can get  one or  more solutions for  a trihedral  vertex.  If the
vertex  has more  than three planes,  then there  are more constraints
than necessary, and one may have to resort to least squares..."

Alone, the geometry isn't enough:
You also require intensity stuff.
We get enough data if points are tri-planed,
While four leave the gradients over-constrained.

On Matched Filters:

The ancients used potions, their love schemes to hatch;
They knew the right philtre encouraged a match.
When a lad made a wink at a comely young lass,
The philtre she used was designed for a pass.
The signals to use were determined by philtre;
The two peaked as one, for the lad could not jilt her.
The two thus entwined, so that noise did not bother
(Excepting that made by the groom's in-law mother...)

Thus was the ancestry of the Lisp Machine editor begun.  And the
bastard child of EINE was Hemlock, which did abide in the land of
Spice Lisp, whose secrets were held by the Priests of the Carnegie
Mellon.  And Hemlock did prosper in the land of Spice Lisp, and did
grow beyond the narrow borders of PERQ.  For the land of Spice Lisp
became bound by marriage to the Common Lisp, and Hemlock did forsake
the language of MacLisp and its father EINE, and did sow new children
upon the ground of the Common Lisp of the Priests of Carnegie Mellon,
where its progeny would spread across Unix systems everywhere.  But
the Great Emacs of Saint IGNUcius would overtake the spread of
Hemlock, for Saint IGNUcius spread a gospel far sweeter to the ears of
the masses than that of the authors of the Common Lisp Standard.  Yea,
Hemlock, though it continue on even to this day amongst the

marginalized as it required a particular Common Lisp, whereas the

Ah, but CL has a Dark Side, my young padewan, and you must take care
not to give yourself over to it.

CL's Force is the fact that it is a language-building language.  For any
application domain, there may be a way of expressing that domain in such
a way that it becomes natural to solve problems in that domain.  CL
shows itself most worthy in building those language domains.

But alas, many times a student of CL will become enamoured with his
own domain, thinking it is the best or only domain and thus his little
language that he has created is a better language than CL.  Thus starts
the flirtation with the Dark Side: "if my little language suits me better
than just CL, then my little language must be better than CL and I should
promote it".

If you learn Lisp correctly, you can grok all programming styles with
it: procedural, OO, predicate, functional, pure or full of
side-effects. Recursion will be your friend, function references your
allies, you will truly know what a closure is, and that an argument
stack is actually a performance hack. You will see that the most
elegant way to solve a problem is to create a custom language, solve
the generic problem, and have your specific one fall out as a special
case. You will learn to truly separate intent from the bare metal, and
you will finally understand the two deepest secrets, which are really
the same secret, which we tell all, but so few understand, that code
and data are the same thing, but organize your data and your code will
follow.

Infrequently Asked Questions about Common Lisp

Q: Why doesn't (sort my-variable)  update the variable?
A: The default calling convention in Common Lisp is call by value, so it
can't  modify arguments passed into a function. Use the appropriate compiler
switch to make it call by reference.

Infrequently Asked Questions about Common Lisp

Q: What's a 'special variable'?
A: Some variables have values that must be accessed very quickly. They are
stored in memory that is connected to the CPU by a high speed datapath called
'the short bus'. Special variables ride the short bus.

Java was, as Gosling says in the first Java white paper, designed for average
programmers. It's a perfectly legitimate goal to design a language for
average programmers. (Or for that matter for small children, like Logo.) But
it is also a legitimate, and very different, goal to design a langauge for
good programmers.

In Lisp, if you want to do aspect-oriented programming, you just do a bunch of
macros and you're there. In Java, you have to get Gregor Kiczales to go out
and start a new company, taking months and years and try to get that to work.
Lisp still has the advantage there, it's just a question of people wanting
that.

language of choice.

Q: How can you tell when you've reached Lisp Enlightenment?
A: The parentheses disappear.
%
More than anything else, I think it is the ability of Lisp programs to
manipulate Lisp expressions that sets Lisp apart. And so no one who has
not written a lot of macros is really in a position to compare Lisp to
other languages. When I hear people complain about Lisp's parentheses,
it sounds to my ears like someone saying: "I tried one of those bananas,
which you say are so delicious. The white part was ok, but the yellow
part was very tough and tasted awful."

Although my own previous enthusiasm has been for syntactically rich languages,
like the Algol family, I now see clearly and concretely the force of Minsky's

well worth the sacrifice of visual form.
