# Fortunes

A collection of various fortune files from the Clojure, Lisp and Haskell communities.

## Contributing

PRs welcome.
Fortunes should match the `strfile(1)` format with `%` being used as the string delimiter.

```
the previous last fortune
%
some new joke
```

In general, quotes are in IRC log format ala:

```
%
<somebody> something funny
```

Plain text formatting incl' whitespace and wrapping should probably be to something like 80 or 100ch, but there's no real standard in these files.
